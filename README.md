#  Hey There <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Waving%20Hand.png" alt="Waving Hand" width="25" height="25" />

Hello! I'm Kapil Sharma, a passionate Software Development Engineer with a focus on React.js and Java. Over the past four years, I've had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects at Accenture and Lowe's. Currently, I'm pursuing my Master‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology, with an expected graduation in May 2025.

During my time at Lowe's, I had the privilege of training many colleagues in the fundamentals of React.js, with my sessions being recorded and shared across multiple teams. I also maintain a [blog](https://curositech.wordpress.com/) where I share insights and experiences from my professional journey. I was honored to receive the Pinnacle Award, a company-wide recognition given to employees who consistently exceed expectations.

Outside of programming, I enjoy trekking (I recently visited the Smoky Mountains), playing and watching soccer (a dedicated FC Barcelona fan), and writing screenplays or short stories, which I publish on a separate blog. My current favorite non-fiction book is The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel, and my all-time favorite is the classic Frankenstein by Mary Shelley.
