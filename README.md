# Welcome to Kapil Sharma's GitHub Repository üéâ

Hello! I'm Kapil Sharma, a passionate Software Development Engineer specializing in full-stack development. Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my projects, experiences, and insights in the world of software engineering.

## My Story üìñ

Hi there! I'm Kapil Sharma, a passionate and dedicated Software Development Engineer with a love for full-stack development. My journey in the world of technology began in the bustling city of Mumbai, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronics & Telecommunications from the University of Mumbai.

With a strong foundation in engineering, I ventured into the professional world, joining Accenture as a fresh graduate. Over the years, I honed my skills, moving from an Associate Software Development Engineer to a Software Development Engineer II. During this time, I worked on diverse projects, from modernizing legacy systems to developing high-performance web applications, always with a focus on creating efficient and scalable solutions.

My quest for knowledge and excellence didn't stop there. In pursuit of deeper understanding and greater challenges, I decided to further my education. Currently, I am a Master's student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, delving into advanced topics in Computer Science. Balancing my studies with hands-on projects, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

My professional experience spans across companies like Lowe's and Accenture, where I've been instrumental in developing and deploying critical software solutions. At Lowe's, I built a sophisticated payment dashboard interface using Next.js, which now aids 8000 vendors in tracking their payments and finances. At Accenture, I played a key role in optimizing data processing systems and modernizing web applications, significantly improving their performance and user experience.

Beyond my professional life, I am a keen researcher. One of my notable projects involved Bayesian Image Segmentation, where I worked as a Research Assistant at RIT. This project allowed me to push the boundaries of computer vision, experimenting with algorithms on a massive dataset of over 10,000 images.

I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge. As a mentor, I have trained over 20 associates in React.js, helping them upskill and grow in their careers. My contributions have been recognized with prestigious awards, such as the ‚ÄòPinnacle Award‚Äô at Accenture.

When I'm not coding or researching, you can find me exploring new technologies, writing on my tech blog, or watching Soccer (FC Barcelona Fan). ‚öΩ
